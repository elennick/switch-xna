**Switch!** is a *XBox Live Indie Game (XBLIG)* that was released in December 2010 on the XBox 360. This specific repository houses the code for the original release of **Switch!** that was built on XNA 3.1. The code is here just for posterity. Feel free to browse even though it looks like it was coded by a 3rd grader.
